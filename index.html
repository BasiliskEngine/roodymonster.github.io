			Welcome to GoStar! GoStar is a competitive and fast-paced fighting game, focused on high mechanics and micromanagement.
			GoStar has currently not reached the Alpha stage, but has reached the beginning of it's life time. This homepage will
			most likely act as the game blog, so that everybody can keep up with it's development. In addition, I am developing 
			plenty of resources to help you guys get started in learning the game, because it is very punishing on in-experienced
			brawlers. As the developer of GoStar, I am taking focus on creating a meta game and adding new content to ensure that 
			the gameplay and the experience is consistently fluid and flawless for the player. Since I just started this project, 
			allow time before you can grab a quick build of the game, and before any screenshots are leaked. Anyways, I hope 
			everybody gets to be part of and enjoy the competitive fighting experience that is GoStar.
